TopoFlow version 3.6 is an update to version 3.5 that runs in Python 3.7.
TopoFlow 3.5 is in the "topoflow" repository and runs in Python 2.7. 
Both are Python packages.

The best way to learn about TopoFlow --- including its history, capabilities, input data preparation and an example application --- is to read the paper in the "docs" folder called:  "Peckham_et_al_2017_GPF.pdf", along with its appendices "Peckham_et_al_2017_GPF_Appendices.pdf".

TopoFlow versions 3.5 and 3.6 provide a plug-and-play, component-based modeling framework for spatial hydrologic modeling.  Both use the EMELI framework to couple a set of user-selected components into a functioning model.  The EMELI framework is included in the topoflow "framework" folder.  A paper on EMELI is included in the "docs" folder, called:  "Peckham_2014_EMELI_FINAL.pdf".
